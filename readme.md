# Making Matters Lexicon

This repository contains the styling of the Making Matters book as a Flask plugin 
for [wiki2print](https://github.com/hackersanddesigners/wiki2print)
It uses Gulp for compiling Sass and Browser-sync. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build
- [Wiki2Print](https://github.com/hackersanddesigners/wiki2print)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

First install the dependencies

    npm install

Then start the Gulp default task by running

    gulp default

This assumes you already have the wiki2print server running somewhere.
